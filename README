TicGit Distributed Ticketing System
===================================

This project provides a ticketing system built on Git that is kept in a
separate branch in your projects Git repository.


Prerequisites
===================================

It is assumed that you already have a recent version of the Git revision
control system installed. If it is not available through your package
manager, you can download the latest Git source code from
http://git-scm.com/ instead.

It is also assumed that you have a recent version of rubygems installed.
Older versions, such as the one available on Debian 5.0.5, will not work
out of the box with the new gem repositories. If you are running an
older version of rubygems, you may need to get the latest rubygems
package from http://rubygems.org/ before being able to properly install
the git and ticgit gems.


Installing
===================================

TicGit depends on the 'git' gem (>= 1.0.5).

To install all dependencies automatically you can use `rake setup`, and to create a gem and install it, just issue `rake install`.
