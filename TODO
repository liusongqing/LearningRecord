* Write more specs
  - There should be detailed specs for most if not all functions


* Switch to using the Grit gem instead of the Git gem
  - This needs to be looked at further, the git gem isn't in active development and yet it seems to provide more functionality (it does pull/push, reset[hard]) than the grit gem.  There are indications that the git gem is deprecated in favour of the grit gem, but if the grit gem doesn't provide the same functionality as the git gem I hardly see the motivation to switch.  That being said, an effort is already being made to switch the existing codebase over to using the Grit gem, and this can be found in jeffWelling's switch_to_grit branch available on github at http://github.com/jeffWelling/ticgit/commits/switch_to_grit


* Add ability to export / import tickets and state
  - It would be cool to have the ability to export and import the tickets and ticgit state from ticgit.  Ideally, the file format exported in should be optionally supplied as an argument. Filetypes could include Yaml, Marshal binary files, CSVs..

* Add ability to change how ticgit stores itself
  - The way that ticgit stores itself in one branch is somewhat limiting, it does not accomodate situations where you may want to have a seperate bug tracker per branch.  Adding the ability for ticgit to store it's ticket and state information in a YAML file in the branch with the working tree would solve this.

  - This may introduce problems, such as how to decide which 'storage method' to use when multiple 'instances' exist (and perhaps conflict with each other), but this could be mitigated by storing a preference such as is already done with the ~/.ticgit dir.
